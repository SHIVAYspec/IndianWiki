# How to use
## Development server
``` sh
npm install
npm run dev # For development server
```
## Build for production server
``` sh
npm install
npm run build # Output will be in 'dist' directory
# Since it uses react router.
# The web server should be configured to redirect all the missing links to index.html.
```
